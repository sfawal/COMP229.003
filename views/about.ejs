  <P><b>Who am I?</b> </P>
  <p>My name is Syeda Fawal. I live in Toronto, Canada. I am currently in my 4th semester at centennial college for the program Software Engineering Technology. I work at a Long Term Care home in Scarborough helping the elderly navigate their daily life alongside nurses and psws. Some of my hobbies include: napping, reading, hiking and movies. I am the oldest of 4 siblings and love bossing the others around. I have 2 cats: Roma and Koya who are beautiful Russian Blue. </p>
